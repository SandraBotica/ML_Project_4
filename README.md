## Project 4 Report - Heart Disease Analysis and Prediction.

## Overview.
### The purpose of this analysis was to use my knowledge of machine learning to create a binary classifier that can predict the chance of a heart disease.

The dataset was obtained from Kaggle.
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashikrahmanpritom/heart-attack-analysis-prediction-dataset?select=heart.csv

 - Age : Age of the patient
 - Sex : Sex of the patient (1 = male, 0 = female)
 - cp : Chest Pain type (0: typical angina, 1: atypical angina, 2: non-anginal pain, 3: asymptomatic)
 - trtbps : resting blood pressure (in mm Hg) on admission to hospital
 - chol : serum cholestoral in mg/dl fetched via BMI sensor
 - fbs : fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true, 0 = false)
 - rest_ecg : resting electrocardiographic results (0: normal, 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV), 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy)
 - thalach : maximum heart rate achieved
 - exang: exercise induced angina (1 = yes, 0 = no)
 - old peak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
 - slp: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment (0 = unsloping, 1 = flat, 2 = downsloping)
 - ca: number of major vessels (0-4) colored by flourosopy
 - thall : thalassemia (0 = null, 1 = fixed defect, 2 = normal, 3 = reversable defect)
 - output: diagnosis of heart disease (angiographic disease status)(0: < 50% diameter narrowing. less chance of heart disease, 1: > 50% diameter narrowing. more chance of heart disease)

## Data Preprocessing

### What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?

### What variable(s) are the features for your model?
### What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?

# Data Model Implementation.
## Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model.

### How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?

### Did I achieve the target model performance of 75% classification accuracy or 0.8 R-squared?

# Data Model Optimisation.
### What steps I took to increase model performance?


## Results
