## Project 4 Report - Heart Attack Analysis and Prediction.

## Overview.
### The purpose of this analysis was to use my knowledge of machine learning to create a binary classifier that can predict the chance of a heart attack.

The dataset was obtained from Kaggle.

age,sex,cp,trtbps,chol,fbs,restecg,thalachh,exng,oldpeak,slp,caa,thall,output
Age : Age of the patient
Sex : Sex of the patient
    Value 1 = male
    Value 0 = female
cp : Chest Pain type 
    Value 0: typical angina
    Value 1: atypical angina
    Value 2: non-anginal pain
    Value 3: asymptomatic
trtbps : resting blood pressure (in mm Hg) on admission to hospital
chol : serum cholestoral in mg/dl fetched via BMI sensor
fbs : fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
    Value 1 = true
    Value 0 = false
rest_ecg : resting electrocardiographic results
    Value 0: normal
    Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)
    Value 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria
thalach : maximum heart rate achieved
exang: exercise induced angina
    Value 1 = yes
    Value 0 = no
old peak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
slp: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
    Value 0 = unsloping
    Value 1 = flat
    Value 2 = downsloping
ca: number of major vessels (0-4) colored by flourosopy
thall : thalassemia
    Value 0 = null
    Value 1 = fixed defect
    Value 2 = normal
    Value 3 = reversable defect
output: diagnosis of heart disease (angiographic disease status)
    Value 0: < 50% diameter narrowing. less chance of heart disease
    Value 1: > 50% diameter narrowing. more chance of heart disease

## Data Preprocessing

### What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?

### What variable(s) are the features for your model?
### What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?

# Data Model Implementation.
## Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model.

### How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?

### Did I achieve the target model performance of 75% classification accuracy or 0.8 R-squared?

# Data Model Optimisation.
### What steps I took to increase model performance?


## Results
## Summary.

### Enjoy marking! Sandra
